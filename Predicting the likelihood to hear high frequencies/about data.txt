Data

An experiment was conducted on 5000 participants to study the effects of age and physical health on hearing loss,specifically the ability to hear high pitched tones. 
This data displays the result of the study in which participants were evaluated and scored for physical ability and then had to take an audio test (pass/no pass) which evaluated their ability to hear high frequencies. 
The age of the user was also noted. 

Is it possible to build a model that would predict someone's liklihood to hear the high frequency sound based solely on their features (age and physical score)?

Features:

age - Age of participant in years
physical_score - Score achieved during physical exam

Label/Target:
