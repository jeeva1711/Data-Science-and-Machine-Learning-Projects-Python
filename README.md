# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects-Python
These are some of the guided projects that I have learned in an online course in Udemy.

Before taking the online course,I knew nothing but " Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the era".So that grabbed my attention and I started working towards becoming one.
And I'm still working towards it.

After having completed about 85% of the course which covered all the supervised machine learning algorithms, I thought it's very easy to build a machine learning model.
So I started participating in online competitions and soon I realized that "DATA" is not that structured and organised. So 95% of time is spent in cleaning,organizing and analyzing data.
This is nothing but "Feature Engineering" which is the most important topic that plays a very important role in building a good model.
I knew then that it is not as easy as I thought but I'm working towards it.
So that's a brief about my journey towards data science.


Bottomline: I am excited to learn new concepts and I wanted to showcase the machine learning projects that I have worked upon.
